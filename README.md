## Overview
GAPO introduces a novel framework combining GAN-based training dynamics with encoder-only reward models for constrained text generation. Key features:
- üõ†Ô∏è **Adversarial Training**: Automatically generates training samples with progressive difficulty
- üîç **Encoder-only Reward Model**: Better captures prompt-response relationships
- üöÄ **Performance Advantages**: Outperforms PPO/DPO/KTO in fine-grained constraint handling
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Optimized Stability**: Iterative automated training of generator and reward model

## Quick Start
### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install with vLLM support
pip install openrlhf[vllm]
```

### Training
```bash
# Launch GAPO training for Qwen-7B with Longformer reward model
bash train_gapo_qwen_longformer.sh
```
